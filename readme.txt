== Description ==

<a href="https://ithemelandco.com/Plugins/Woocommerce-Product-Table/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=web_links&utm_campaign=user-lite-buy"><strong>WooCommerce Product Table plugin</strong></a> is a useful extension for ecommerce and online store websites designed by Wordpress. This plugin can make a huge change on the appearance of online shopping website.

If you’re already a WooCommerce user, you’re probably familiar with product pages. They can be quite useful for displaying images, sharing information such as dimensions and price, and even enabling customers to make fast purchases.

However, there are some situations where product pages cause more problems than they solve. For example, some products – such as e-books or software – and services don’t benefit from the use of images. In these cases, traditional product pages can look strangely empty.

Additionally, product pages sometimes inhibit browsing and purchasing. If you have a large volume of items available, scrolling through one product page after another can get tiring (and boring) for your customers. Using product pages to add items to a cart individually is also time-consuming and tedious.
